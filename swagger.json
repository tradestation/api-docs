    "description": "This document describes the resources that make up the official TradeStation\nAPI. If you have any problems or requests please contact [support](mailto:ClientExperience@tradestation.com).\n\nOverview\n========\n\nThe TradeStation API is reachable at the base-url:\n```\nhttps://api.tradestation.com/v2\n```\n\nCurrent Version\n---------------\n\nThe latest version is 20160101, but currently we are in transition, so by\ndefault all requests receive the 20101026 version for backwards compatibility.\n\nAlways explicitly request this version by adding the `APIVersion`\nquerystring parameter as shown below:\n\n```\nhttps://api.tradestation.com/v2/data/quote/msft?APIVersion=20160101\n```\n\nNote: This will ensure your application will not be broken when we deprecate\nthe 20101026 version in favor of 20160101 or newer versions.\n\nSIM vs LIVE\n-----------\n\nWe also offer a Simulator(SIM) API for \"Paper Trading\" that is identical\nto the Live API in all ways except it uses fake trading accounts seeded with\nfake money and orders are not actually executed - only simulated executions\noccur with instant \"fills\".\n\nTo access the SIM environment, you must change your base-url to:\n```\nhttps://sim-api.tradestation.com/v2\n```\n\n**WARNING:** TradeStation is not liable for mistakes made by applications\nthat allow users to switch between SIM and Live environments.\n\n### Why offer a Simulator?\n\nTransactional API calls such as Order Execution offers users or applications\nthe ability to experiment within a Simulated trading system so that real\naccounts and money are not affected and trades are not actually executed.\n\nOther potential use-cases:\n- Learning how to use applications via Paper Trading.\n- Exploring TradeStation API behavior without financial ramifications\n- Testing apps and websites before making them Live to customers\n- Enabling users to \"Try-before-they-buy\" with apps that use the TradeStation API\n- Hosting trading competitions or games\n\n\nHTTP Requests\n-------------\n\nAll API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the https://api.tradestation.com.\nAll data is sent and received as JSON, with some limited support for XML.\n\nExample Request:\n```\ncurl -i https://api.tradestation.com/v2/data/quote/msft?APIVersion=20160101\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: private\nContent-Length: 1545\nContent-Type: application/default+json; charset=utf-8\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nAPIVersion: 20160101\nDate: Wed, 30 Nov 2016 01:51:45 GMT\n\n[\n...json...\n]\n```\n\n### Common Conventions\n\n- Blank fields may either be included as null or omitted, so please support both.\n- All timestamps are returned in [Epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) format unless stated otherwise.\n\n\n\nHTTP Streaming\n--------------\n\nThe TradeStation API offers HTTP Streaming responses for some specialized\nresources including barcharts, quote changes, option chains, and option spread quotes (including single options). \nThese streams conform to RFC2616 for HTTP/1.1 Streaming with some slight\nmodifications.\n\n> The HTTP streaming mechanism keeps a request open indefinitely.  It\n> never terminates the request or closes the connection, even after the\n> server pushes data to the client.  This mechanism significantly\n> reduces the network latency because the client and the server do not\n> need to open and close the connection.\n>\n> The basic life cycle of an application using HTTP streaming is as\n> follows:\n>\n> 1.  The client makes an initial request and then waits for a\n>     response.\n>\n> 2.  The server defers the response to a poll request until an update\n>     is available, or until a particular status or timeout has\n>     occurred.\n>\n> 3.  Whenever an update is available, the server sends it back to the\n>     client as a part of the response.\n>\n> 4.  The data sent by the server does not terminate the request or the\n>     connection.  The server returns to step 3.\n>\n> The HTTP streaming mechanism is based on the capability of the server\n> to send several pieces of information in the same response, without\n> terminating the request or the connection.\n\nSource: [RFC6202, Page 7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6202#page-7).\n\nHTTP Streaming resources are identified under in this documentation as such,\nall other resources conform to the HTTP Request pattern instead.\n\nThe HTTP Streaming response is returned with the following headers:\n\n  ```\n  Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n  Content-Type: application/vnd.tradestation.streams+json\n  ```\n\nNote: The `Content-Length` header is typically omitted since the response\nbody size is unknown.\n\nStreams consist of a series of chunks that contain individual JSON objects\nto be parsed separately rather than as a whole response body.\n\nOne unique thing about TradeStation's HTTP Streams is they also can terminate\nunlike a canonical HTTP/1.1 Stream.\n\nStreams terminate with a non-JSON string prefixed with one of the following:\n\n  - `END`\n  - `ERROR`\n\nIn the case of `ERROR`, it will often be followed by an error message like:\n\n```\nERROR - A Timeout Occurred after waiting 15000ms\n```\n\nIn either case, the HTTP client must terminate the HTTP Stream and end the\nHTTP Request lifetime as a result of these messages. In the case of `ERROR`\nthe client application may add a delay before re-requesting the HTTP Stream.\n\n### How to handle HTTP Chunked Encoded Streams\n\nHealthy chunked-encoded streams emit variable length chunks that contain\nparsable JSON.\n\nFor example:\n```\nGET https://sim.api.tradestation.com/v2/stream/barchart/$DJI/1/Minute/12-26-2016/01-24-2017\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Wed, 14 Jun 2017 01:17:36 GMT\nContent-Type: application/vnd.tradestation.streams+json\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nCache-Control: private\n\n114\n{\"Close\":19956.09,\"DownTicks\":26,\"DownVolume\":940229,\"High\":19961.77,\"Low\":19943.46,\"Open\":19943.46,\"Status\":13,\"TimeStamp\":\"\\/Date(1482849060000)\\/\",\"TotalTicks\":59,\"TotalVolume\":3982533,\"UnchangedTicks\":0,\"UnchangedVolume\":0,\"UpTicks\":33,\"UpVolume\":3042304,\"OpenInterest\":0}\n\n\n112\n{\"Close\":19950.82,\"DownTicks\":32,\"DownVolume\":440577,\"High\":19959.15,\"Low\":19947.34,\"Open\":19955.64,\"Status\":13,\"TimeStamp\":\"\\/Date(1482849120000)\\/\",\"TotalTicks\":60,\"TotalVolume\":761274,\"UnchangedTicks\":0,\"UnchangedVolume\":0,\"UpTicks\":28,\"UpVolume\":320697,\"OpenInterest\":0}\n\n\nEND\n```\n\nTypically this will stream forever, unless a network interruption or service\ndisruption occurs. It is up to the client to properly handle stream lifetime\nand connection closing.\n\n### How to parse JSON chunks\n\nIn order to process these chunks, API consumers should first read the\nresponse buffer, then de-chunk the plain-text strings, and finally identify\nnew JSON objects by applying tokenizing techniques to the resulting text\nstream using either a streaming JSON parser, Regex, a lexer/parser, or\nbrute-force string indexing logic.\n\nA simple but effective technique is after de-chunking to simply parse based\nupon the `\\n` (newline character) delimiter written to the end of each\nJSON object. However, a more robust solution is less likely to break later.\n\n#### Variable Length JSON Chunking\n\nAs a developer, be careful with how you parse HTTP Streams, because the\nAPI’s or intermediate proxies may chunk JSON objects many different ways.\n\n> Using HTTP streaming, several application\n> messages can be sent within a single HTTP response.  The\n> separation of the response stream into application messages needs\n> to be performed at the application level and not at the HTTP\n> level.  In particular, it is not possible to use the HTTP chunks\n> as application message delimiters, since intermediate proxies\n> might “re-chunk” the message stream (for example, by combining\n> different chunks into a longer one).  This issue does not affect\n> the HTTP long polling technique, which provides a canonical\n> framing technique: each application message can be sent in a\n> different HTTP response.\n\nSource: [RFC6202, Section 3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6202#section-3.2)\n\nTranslation: Be prepared for JSON objects that span chunks. You may see\nchunks with varying numbers of JSON objects, including:\n\n- \"exactly 1\" JSON object per chunk\n- “at least 1” JSON object per chunk\n- 1 JSON object split across 2 or more chunks\n\nExample of 2 JSON objects in 1 chunk:\n```\nGET https://sim.api.tradestation.com/v2/stream/barchart/$DJI/1/Minute/12-26-2016/01-24-2017\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Wed, 14 Jun 2017 01:17:36 GMT\nContent-Type: application/vnd.tradestation.streams+json\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nCache-Control: private\n\n22d\n{\"Close\":19956.09,\"DownTicks\":26,\"DownVolume\":940229,\"High\":19961.77,\"Low\":19943.46,\"Open\":19943.46,\"Status\":13,\"TimeStamp\":\"\\/Date(1482849060000)\\/\",\"TotalTicks\":59,\"TotalVolume\":3982533,\"UnchangedTicks\":0,\"UnchangedVolume\":0,\"UpTicks\":33,\"UpVolume\":3042304,\"OpenInterest\":0}\n{\"Close\":19950.82,\"DownTicks\":32,\"DownVolume\":440577,\"High\":19959.15,\"Low\":19947.34,\"Open\":19955.64,\"Status\":13,\"TimeStamp\":\"\\/Date(1482849120000)\\/\",\"TotalTicks\":60,\"TotalVolume\":761274,\"UnchangedTicks\":0,\"UnchangedVolume\":0,\"UpTicks\":28,\"UpVolume\":320697,\"OpenInterest\":0}\nEND\n```\n\nExample of 1 JSON objects split across 2 chunks:\n```\nGET https://sim.api.tradestation.com/v2/stream/barchart/$DJI/1/Minute/12-26-2016/01-24-2017\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Wed, 14 Jun 2017 01:17:36 GMT\nContent-Type: application/vnd.tradestation.streams+json\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nCache-Control: private\n\n40\n{\"Close\":71.65,\"DownTicks\":45,\"DownVolume\":5406,\"High\":71.67,\"Lo\nC2\nw\":71.65,\"Open\":71.66,\"Status\":13,\"TimeStamp\":\"\\/Date(1497016260000)\\/\",\"TotalTicks\":77,\"TotalVolume\":17270,\"UnchangedTicks\":0,\"UnchangedVolume\":0,\"UpTicks\":32,\"UpVolume\":11864,\"OpenInterest\":0}\n\nEND\n```\n\nThis is allowed by the HTTP/1.1 specification, but can be confusing or lead\nto bugs in client applications if you try to depend parsing JSON along\nthe HTTP chunk-boundaries because even if it works during testing, later if\nusers connect from a different network, it may change the chunking behavior.\n\nFor example, if you are at a coffee shop with wifi which employs an\nHTTP Proxy, then it may buffer the stream and change the chunking boundary\nfrom 1 JSON object per chunk, to splitting each JSON object across 2 or 3.\n\nIn fact, the HTTP/1.1 spec clearly advises developers of proxies to always\n“re-chunk” HTTP Streams, so this is almost a guarantee to happen in the wild.\n\nHTTP Streaming API consumers should be prepared to support all variations.\n\n\n\n\nRate Limiting\n-------------\n\nThe TradeStation API Rate Limits on the number of requests a given user &\nclient can make to the API in order to ensure fairness between users and\nprevent abuse to our network. Each API Key is allocated quota settings upon\ncreation. These settings are applied on a per-user basis. If the quota is\nexceeded, an HTTP response of `403 Quota Exceeded` will be\nreturned. Quotas are reset on a 5-minute interval based on when the user\nissued the first request.\n\n## Resource Categories\n\nThe rate limit applies to the following resource-categories:\n\n| Resource-Category                             | Quota | Interval |\n| --------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------- |\n| Accounts                                      | 250   | 5-minute |\n| Order Details                                 | 250   | 5-minute |\n| Balances                                      | 250   | 5-minute |\n| Positions                                     | 250   | 5-minute |\n| Data Quotes                                   | 250   | 5-minute |\n| Quote Change Stream                           | 500   | 5-minute |\n| Quote Snapshot Stream                         | 500   | 5-minute |\n| Barchart Stream                               | 500   | 5-minute |\n| TickBar Stream                                | 500   | 5-minute |\n\n\n\n## Intervals\n\nQuotas have \"Windows\" that last for a limited time interval\n(generally 5-minutes). Once the user has exceeded the maximum request count,\nall future requests will fail with a `403` error until the interval expires.\nRate Limit intervals do not slide based upon the number of requests, they are\nfixed at a point in time starting from the very first request for that\ncategory of resource.  After the interval expires, the cycle will\nstart over at zero and the user can make more requests.\n\n### Example A\n\nA user logs into the TradeStation WebAPI with your application and issues a\nrequest to `/v2/EliteTrader/accounts`. As a result, the request\nquota is incremented by one for the `Accounts` resource-category. The user\nthen issues 250 more requests immediately to `/v2/EliteTrader/accounts`.\nThe last request fails with `403 Quota Exceeded`. All subsequent requests\ncontinue to fail until the 5-minute interval expires from the time of the\nvery first request.\n\n### Example B\n\nA user logs into the TradeStation WebAPI with your application and issues a\nrequest to `/v2/data/quote/IBM,NFLX,MSFT,AMZN,AAPL`. As a result, the\nrequest quota is incremented by one for the `Data Quotes`\nresource-category. The user then immediately issues the same request 250 more\ntimes. The last request fails with `403 Quota Exceeded`. All\nsubsequent requests continue to fail until the 5-minute interval expires\nfrom the time of the first request.\n\n**Example Throttled Request**\n```\nGET https://api.tradestation.com/v2/data/quotes/IBM,NFLX,MSFT,AMZN,AAPL HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.tradestation.com\nAuthorization: bearer eE45VkdQSnlBcmI0Q2RqTi82SFdMSVE0SXMyOFo5Z3dzVzdzdk\nAccept: application/json\n```\n**Example Failed Response**\n```\nHTTP/1.1 403 Quota Exceeded\nContent-Length: 15\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/7.5\nX-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319\nDate: Tue, 06 Dec 2011 20:50:32 GMT\n\n<html><body>Quota Exceeded</body></html>\n```\n",

      "description": "The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access tokens\nand refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients. Since\nthis is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of\ninteracting with the resource owner’s user-agent (typically a web browser)\nand capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection) from the\nauthorization server.\n\n#### Implementation Guide\n\nThe authorization code grant type allows the end users to authenticate\nwith TradeStation directly and authorize the Client application to make\ncalls on their behalf. Access Tokens obtained via the authorization code\nGrant Type can be refreshed, they will expire in 20 minutes of the time\nissued. These access tokens are accepted in the HTTP `Authorization` header.\n\n**Step-by-Step**\n\n**1. Redirect user for authentication/authorization**\n\nThe client application will route the end-user to our MFA (multi-factor\nauthentication) login page web page.\n\n*Authorize Uri:*\n- https://api.tradestation.com/v2/authorize\n\n*Required query string parameters:*\n- redirect_uri\n- client_id = the client application’s API key\n- response_type = code\n\n*Example Authorization Page Url:*\n```\nhttps://api.tradestation.com/v2/authorize/?redirect_uri=https://exampleclientapp.com/authcode.aspx&client_id=D7635234&response_type=code\n```\n\nThe URL will take you to a TradeStation login page.\n\n**2. Client receives authorization code**\n\nUpon successful authentication; The user agent(browser) will be redirected\nto the URL provided and include an Authorization Code in the query string.\n\n*Example Redirect:*\n```\nHTTP 301 Redirect\nRedirectURL = https://exampleclientapp.com/authcode.aspx?code=AFF345CD12B\n```\n\n*Note:*\n\n- This redirect URL can be anything that the user agent can understand.\nIn the case of an embedded browser it could be a URL to a native view,\ni.e.: device://viewname\n- The Authorization Code is only valid for 30 seconds\n\n**3. Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token**\n\nThe Client uses the Authorization Code to request an Access Token via the\n`/security/authorize` service method using the authorization_code grant type;\n\n*Required Header:*\n- Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n- Content-Length = Length of body information in UTF8\n\n*Required form parameters:*\n- grant_type = authorization_code\n- client_id = The client application’s API key\n- redirect_uri = The redirect uri used when obtaining the Authorization\nCode being provided\n- code = The Authorization Code value\n- client_secret = The secret for the client application’s API Key\n\n*Example Request*\n```\nPOST https://api.tradestation.com/v2/Security/Authorize HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nHost: api.tradestation.com\nContent-Length: 630\n\ngrant_type=authorization_code&client_id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111&redirect_uri=test.aspx&client_secret=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111&code=YjlkWDRqVmxlRXphaZzM1NWQ1MzZtVVFJQXFkcmk3eldOSjRUSDJHSklqN1dMNkk=&response_type=token\n```\n\n*Example Response*\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: private\nContent-Length: 927\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/7.5\nX-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319\nX-Powered-By: ASP.NET\nDate: Tue, 06 Dec 2011 20:50:32 GMT\n\n{\n\n    \"refresh_token\": \"eGlhc2xvTTVJaEdXMWs4VjhraWx4bk5QMHJMaA==\",\n    \"expires_in\": 1200,\n    \"access_token\": \"eGlhc2xvozT2IxWnVITmdwGVFPQ==\",\n    \"token_type\": \"AccessToken\",\n    \"userid\": \"testUser\"\n}\n```\n",

They are designed\nto limit loss and lock in profit by “bracketing” an order with a\nsimultaneous stop and limit order.\n\nBracket orders are limited so that the orders are all for the same\nsymbol and are on the same side of the market (either all to sell or\nall to cover), and they are restricted to closing transactions.\n\nThe reason that they follow these rules is because the orders need to be\nable to auto decrement when a partial fill occurs with one of the orders.\nFor example, if the customer has a sell limit order for 1000 shares and\na sell stop order for 1000 shares, and the limit order is partially\nfilled for 500 shares, then the customer would want the stop to remain\nopen, but it should automatically decrement the order to 500 shares to\nmatch the remaining open position.\n\n### Errors\nWhen a submitted order fails, it can be seen in two different ways:\n-\tImmediately rejected during submit to the Orders API with a 400 HTTP status code.\n-\tAccepted by the API with a 200 HTTP status code, but you will see the order with a status of “REJ” (rejected) when you fetch the Order from the /v2/accounts/{id}/orders API\n\n#### NOTE\nWhen a group order is submitted, the order execution system treats each sibling order as an individual order. Thus, the system does not validate that each order has the same Quantity, and currently it is not able to update a bracket order as one transaction, instead you must update each order within a bracket.\n\nIn order to prevent errors, please validate the data on the client side.\n",
