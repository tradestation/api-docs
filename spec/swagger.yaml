  title: Tradestation API
  description: |
    This document describes the resources that make up the official TradeStation
    API. If you have any problems or requests please contact [support](mailto:webapi@tradestation.com).

    Overview
    ========

    The TradeStation API is reachable at the base-url:
    ```
    https://api.tradestation.com/v2
    ```

    Current Version
    ---------------

    The latest version is 20160101, but currently we are in transition, so by
    default all requests receive the 20101026 version for backwards compatibility.

    Always explicitly request this version by adding the `APIVersion`
    querystring parameter as shown below:

    ```
    https://api.tradestation.com/v2/data/quote/msft?APIVersion=20160101
    ```

    Note: This will ensure your application will not be broken when we deprecate
    the 20101026 version in favor of 20160101 or newer versions.

    SIM vs LIVE
    -----------

    We also offer a Simulator(SIM) API for "Paper Trading" that is identical
    to the Live API in all ways except it uses fake trading accounts seeded with
    fake money and orders are not actually executed - only simulated executions
    occur with instant "fills".

    To access the SIM environment, you must change your base-url to:
    ```
    https://sim-api.tradestation.com/v2
    ```

    **WARNING:** TradeStation is not liable for mistakes made by applications
    that allow users to switch between SIM and Live environments.

    ### Why offer a Simulator?

    Transactional API calls such as Order Execution offers users or applications
    the ability to experiment within a Simulated trading system so that real
    accounts and money are not affected and trades are not actually executed.

    Other potential use-cases:
    - Learning how to use applications via Paper Trading.
    - Exploring TradeStation API behavior without financial ramifications
    - Testing apps and websites before making them Live to customers
    - Enabling users to "Try-before-they-buy" with apps that use the TradeStation API
    - Hosting trading competitions or games


    HTTP Requests
    -------------

    All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the https://api.tradestation.com.
    All data is sent and received as JSON, with some limited support for XML.

    Example Request:
    ```
    curl -i https://api.tradestation.com/v2/data/quote/msft?APIVersion=20160101

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Cache-Control: private
    Content-Length: 1545
    Content-Type: application/default+json; charset=utf-8
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    APIVersion: 20160101
    Date: Wed, 30 Nov 2016 01:51:45 GMT

    [
    ...json...
    ]
    ```

    ### Common Conventions

    - Blank fields may either be included as null or omitted, so please support both.
    - All timestamps are returned in [Epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) format unless stated otherwise.



    HTTP Streaming
    --------------

    The TradeStation API offers HTTP Streaming responses for some specialized
    resources including intraday barcharts, quote changes, and quote snapshots.
    These streams conform to RFC2616 for HTTP/1.1 Streaming with some slight
    modifications.

    > The HTTP streaming mechanism keeps a request open indefinitely.  It
    > never terminates the request or closes the connection, even after the
    > server pushes data to the client.  This mechanism significantly
    > reduces the network latency because the client and the server do not
    > need to open and close the connection.
    >
    > The basic life cycle of an application using HTTP streaming is as
    > follows:
    >
    > 1.  The client makes an initial request and then waits for a
    >     response.
    >
    > 2.  The server defers the response to a poll request until an update
    >     is available, or until a particular status or timeout has
    >     occurred.
    >
    > 3.  Whenever an update is available, the server sends it back to the
    >     client as a part of the response.
    >
    > 4.  The data sent by the server does not terminate the request or the
    >     connection.  The server returns to step 3.
    >
    > The HTTP streaming mechanism is based on the capability of the server
    > to send several pieces of information in the same response, without
    > terminating the request or the connection.

    Source: [RFC6202, Page 7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6202#page-7).

    HTTP Streaming resources are identified under in this documentation as such,
    all other resources conform to the HTTP Request pattern instead.

    The HTTP Streaming response is returned with the following headers:

      ```
      Transfer-Encoding: chunked
      Content-Type: application/vnd.tradestation.streams+json
      ```

    Note: The `Content-Length` header is typically omitted since the response
    body size is unknown.

    Streams consist of a series of chunks that contain individual JSON objects
    to be parsed separately rather than as a whole response body.

    One unique thing about TradeStation's HTTP Streams is they also can terminate
    unlike a canonical HTTP/1.1 Stream.

    Streams terminate with a non-JSON string prefixed with one of the following:

      - `END`
      - `ERROR`

    In the case of `ERROR`, it will often be followed by an error message like:

    ```
    ERROR - A Timeout Occurred after waiting 15000ms
    ```

    In either case, the HTTP client must terminate the HTTP Stream and end the
    HTTP Request lifetime as a result of these messages. In the case of `ERROR`
    the client application may add a delay before re-requesting the HTTP Stream.

    ### How to handle HTTP Chunked Encoded Streams

    Healthy chunked-encoded streams emit variable length chunks that contain
    parsable JSON.

    For example:
    ```
    GET https://sim.api.tradestation.com/v2/stream/barchart/$DJI/1/Minute/12-26-2016/01-24-2017?access_token=…

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Wed, 14 Jun 2017 01:17:36 GMT
    Content-Type: application/vnd.tradestation.streams+json
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Connection: keep-alive
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Cache-Control: private

    114
    {"Close":19956.09,"DownTicks":26,"DownVolume":940229,"High":19961.77,"Low":19943.46,"Open":19943.46,"Status":13,"TimeStamp":"\/Date(1482849060000)\/","TotalTicks":59,"TotalVolume":3982533,"UnchangedTicks":0,"UnchangedVolume":0,"UpTicks":33,"UpVolume":3042304,"OpenInterest":0}


    112
    {"Close":19950.82,"DownTicks":32,"DownVolume":440577,"High":19959.15,"Low":19947.34,"Open":19955.64,"Status":13,"TimeStamp":"\/Date(1482849120000)\/","TotalTicks":60,"TotalVolume":761274,"UnchangedTicks":0,"UnchangedVolume":0,"UpTicks":28,"UpVolume":320697,"OpenInterest":0}


    END
    ```

    Typically this will stream forever, unless a network interruption or service
    disruption occurs. It is up to the client to properly handle stream lifetime
    and connection closing.

    ### How to parse JSON chunks

    In order to process these chunks, API consumers should first read the
    response buffer, then de-chunk the plain-text strings, and finally identify
    new JSON objects by applying tokenizing techniques to the resulting text
    stream using either a streaming JSON parser, Regex, a lexer/parser, or
    brute-force string indexing logic.

    A simple but effective technique is after de-chunking to simply parse based
    upon the `\n` (newline character) delimiter written to the end of each
    JSON object. However, a more robust solution is less likely to break later.

    #### Variable Length JSON Chunking

    As a developer, be careful with how you parse HTTP Streams, because the
    API’s or intermediate proxies may chunk JSON objects many different ways.

    > Using HTTP streaming, several application
    > messages can be sent within a single HTTP response.  The
    > separation of the response stream into application messages needs
    > to be performed at the application level and not at the HTTP
    > level.  In particular, it is not possible to use the HTTP chunks
    > as application message delimiters, since intermediate proxies
    > might “re-chunk” the message stream (for example, by combining
    > different chunks into a longer one).  This issue does not affect
    > the HTTP long polling technique, which provides a canonical
    > framing technique: each application message can be sent in a
    > different HTTP response.

    Source: [RFC6202, Section 3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6202#section-3.2)

    Translation: Be prepared for JSON objects that span chunks. You may see
    chunks with varying numbers of JSON objects, including:

    - "exactly 1" JSON object per chunk
    - “at least 1” JSON object per chunk
    - 1 JSON object split across 2 or more chunks

    Example of 2 JSON objects in 1 chunk:
    ```
    GET https://sim.api.tradestation.com/v2/stream/barchart/$DJI/1/Minute/12-26-2016/01-24-2017?access_token=…

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Wed, 14 Jun 2017 01:17:36 GMT
    Content-Type: application/vnd.tradestation.streams+json
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Connection: keep-alive
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Cache-Control: private

    22d
    {"Close":19956.09,"DownTicks":26,"DownVolume":940229,"High":19961.77,"Low":19943.46,"Open":19943.46,"Status":13,"TimeStamp":"\/Date(1482849060000)\/","TotalTicks":59,"TotalVolume":3982533,"UnchangedTicks":0,"UnchangedVolume":0,"UpTicks":33,"UpVolume":3042304,"OpenInterest":0}
    {"Close":19950.82,"DownTicks":32,"DownVolume":440577,"High":19959.15,"Low":19947.34,"Open":19955.64,"Status":13,"TimeStamp":"\/Date(1482849120000)\/","TotalTicks":60,"TotalVolume":761274,"UnchangedTicks":0,"UnchangedVolume":0,"UpTicks":28,"UpVolume":320697,"OpenInterest":0}
    END
    ```

    Example of 1 JSON objects split across 2 chunks:
    ```
    GET https://sim.api.tradestation.com/v2/stream/barchart/$DJI/1/Minute/12-26-2016/01-24-2017?access_token=…

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Wed, 14 Jun 2017 01:17:36 GMT
    Content-Type: application/vnd.tradestation.streams+json
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Connection: keep-alive
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Cache-Control: private

    40
    {"Close":71.65,"DownTicks":45,"DownVolume":5406,"High":71.67,"Lo
    C2
    w":71.65,"Open":71.66,"Status":13,"TimeStamp":"\/Date(1497016260000)\/","TotalTicks":77,"TotalVolume":17270,"UnchangedTicks":0,"UnchangedVolume":0,"UpTicks":32,"UpVolume":11864,"OpenInterest":0}

    END
    ```

    This is allowed by the HTTP/1.1 specification, but can be confusing or lead
    to bugs in client applications if you try to depend parsing JSON along
    the HTTP chunk-boundaries because even if it works during testing, later if
    users connect from a different network, it may change the chunking behavior.

    For example, if you are at a coffee shop with wifi which employs an
    HTTP Proxy, then it may buffer the stream and change the chunking boundary
    from 1 JSON object per chunk, to splitting each JSON object across 2 or 3.

    In fact, the HTTP/1.1 spec clearly advises developers of proxies to always
    “re-chunk” HTTP Streams, so this is almost a guarantee to happen in the wild.

    HTTP Streaming API consumers should be prepared to support all variations.




    Rate Limiting
    -------------

    The TradeStation API Rate Limits on the number of requests a given user &
    client can make to the API in order to ensure fairness between users and
    prevent abuse to our network. Each API Key is allocated quota settings upon
    creation. These settings are applied on a per-user basis. If the quota is
    exceeded, an HTTP response of `403 Quota Exceeded` will be
    returned. Quotas are reset on a 5-minute interval based on when the user
    issued the first request.

    ## Resource Categories

    The rate limit applies to the following resource-categories:

    | Resource-Category                             | Quota | Interval |
    | --------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------- |
    | Accounts                                      | 250   | 5-minute |
    | Order Details                                 | 250   | 5-minute |
    | Balances                                      | 250   | 5-minute |
    | Positions                                     | 250   | 5-minute |
    | Data Quotes                                   | 250   | 5-minute |
    | Quote Change Stream                           | 500   | 5-minute |
    | Quote Snapshot Stream                         | 500   | 5-minute |
    | Barchart Stream                               | 500   | 5-minute |
    | TickBar Stream                                | 500   | 5-minute |



    ## Intervals

    Quotas have "Windows" that last for a limited time interval
    (generally 5-minutes). Once the user has exceeded the maximum request count,
    all future requests will fail with a `403` error until the interval expires.
    Rate Limit intervals do not slide based upon the number of requests, they are
    fixed at a point in time starting from the very first request for that
    category of resource.  After the interval expires, the cycle will
    start over at zero and the user can make more requests.

    ### Example A

    A user logs into the TradeStation WebAPI with your application and issues a
    request to `/v2/EliteTrader/accounts`. As a result, the request
    quota is incremented by one for the `Accounts` resource-category. The user
    then issues 250 more requests immediately to `/v2/EliteTrader/accounts`.
    The last request fails with `403 Quota Exceeded`. All subsequent requests
    continue to fail until the 5-minute interval expires from the time of the
    very first request.

    ### Example B

    A user logs into the TradeStation WebAPI with your application and issues a
    request to `/v2/data/quote/IBM,NFLX,MSFT,AMZN,AAPL`. As a result, the
    request quota is incremented by one for the `Data Quotes`
    resource-category. The user then immediately issues the same request 250 more
    times. The last request fails with `403 Quota Exceeded`. All
    subsequent requests continue to fail until the 5-minute interval expires
    from the time of the first request.

    **Example Throttled Request**
    ```
    GET https://api.tradestation.com/v2/data/quotes/IBM,NFLX,MSFT,AMZN,AAPL HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.tradestation.com
    Authorization: bearer eE45VkdQSnlBcmI0Q2RqTi82SFdMSVE0SXMyOFo5Z3dzVzdzdk
    Accept: application/json
    ```
    **Example Failed Response**
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 403 Quota Exceeded
    Content-Length: 15
    Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
    X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319
    Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2011 20:50:32 GMT

    <html><body>Quota Exceeded</body></html>

  OAuth2-Auth-Code:
    description: |
      The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access tokens
      and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients. Since
      this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
      interacting with the resource owner’s user-agent (typically a web browser)
      and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection) from the
      authorization server.

      #### Implementation Guide

      The authorization code grant type allows the end users to authenticate
      with TradeStation directly and authorize the Client application to make
      calls on their behalf. Access Tokens obtained via the authorization code
      Grant Type can be refreshed, they will expire in 20 minutes of the time
      issued.

      **Step-by-Step**

      **1. Redirect user for authentication/authorization**

      The client application will route the end-user to our MFA (multi-factor
      authentication) login page web page.

      *Authorize Uri:*
      - https://api.tradestation.com/v2/authorize

      *Required query string parameters:*
      - redirect_uri
      - client_id = the client application’s API key
      - response_type = code

      *Example Authorization Page Url:*
      ```
      https://api.tradestation.com/v2/authorize/?redirect_uri=https://exampleclientapp.com/authcode.aspx&client_id=D7635234&response_type=code
      ```

      The URL will take you to a TradeStation login page.

      **2. Client receives authorization code**

      Upon successful authentication; The user agent(browser) will be redirected
      to the URL provided and include an Authorization Code in the query string.

      *Example Redirect:*
      ```
      HTTP 301 Redirect
      RedirectURL = https://exampleclientapp.com/authcode.aspx?code=AFF345CD12B
      ```

      *Note:*

      - This redirect URL can be anything that the user agent can understand.
      In the case of an embedded browser it could be a URL to a native view,
      i.e.: device://viewname
      - The Authorization Code is only valid for 30 seconds

      **3. Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token**

      The Client uses the Authorization Code to request an Access Token via the
      `/security/authorize` service method using the authorization_code grant type;

      *Required Header:*
      - Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
      - Content-Length = Length of body information in UTF8

      *Required form parameters:*
      - grant_type = authorization_code
      - client_id = The client application’s API key
      - redirect_uri = The redirect uri used when obtaining the Authorization
      Code being provided
      - code = The Authorization Code value
      - client_secret = The secret for the client application’s API Key

      *Example Request*
      ```
      POST https://api.tradestation.com/v2/Security/Authorize HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
      Host: api.tradestation.com
      Content-Length: 630

      grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111&redirect_uri=test.aspx&client_secret=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111&code=YjlkWDRqVmxlRXphaZzM1NWQ1MzZtVVFJQXFkcmk3eldOSjRUSDJHSklqN1dMNkk=&response_type=token

        Submit Group Order
      description: |
        Submits a group order such as Bracket and OCO Orders.

        #### Order Cancels Order (OCO)
        An OCO order is a group of orders whereby if one of the orders is filled
        or partially-filled, then all of the other orders in the group are
        cancelled.

        #### Bracket OCO Orders
        A bracket order is a special instance of an OCO (Order Cancel Order).
        Bracket orders are used to exit an existing position. They are designed
        to limit loss and lock in profit by “bracketing” an order with a
        simultaneous stop and limit order.

        Bracket orders are limited so that the orders are all for the same
        symbol and are on the same side of the market (either all to sell or
        all to cover), and they are restricted to closing transactions.

        The reason that they follow these rules is because the orders need to be
        able to auto decrement when a partial fill occurs with one of the orders.
        For example, if the customer has a sell limit order for 1000 shares and
        a sell stop order for 1000 shares, and the limit order is partially
        filled for 500 shares, then the customer would want the stop to remain
        open, but it should automatically decrement the order to 500 shares to
        match the remaining open position.

        ### Errors
        When a submitted order fails, it can be seen in two different ways:
        -	Immediately rejected during submit to the Orders API with a 400 HTTP status code.
        -	Accepted by the API with a 200 HTTP status code, but you will see the order with a status of “REJ” (rejected) when you fetch the Order from the /v2/accounts/{id}/orders API

        #### NOTE
        When a group order is submitted, the order execution system treats each sibling order as an individual order. Thus, the system does not validate that each order has the same Quantity, and currently it is not able to update a bracket order as one transaction, instead you must update each order within a bracket.

        In order to prevent errors, please validate the data on the client side.
